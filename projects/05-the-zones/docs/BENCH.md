# P05 bench log

This is the narrative record: what was run, what came back, and what each result changed. The
figures, when there are any, go in RESULTS.md. Nothing has run on hardware yet.

## Saturday 17 October 2026: the firmware image, and the cheap attempt links

Two results, and the second is stronger than it looks.

**The firmware image is in the workspace.** `west blobs fetch hal_st` took one file:

```
Fetching blob hal_st:
  ~/zephyrproject/modules/hal/st/zephyr/blobs/sensor/vl53l5cx/vl53l5cx_buffers.h
hal_st A sensor/vl53l5cx/vl53l5cx_buffers.h lib
```

Two things were shortened to fit the page and both are said rather than hidden: the home
directory is written `~`, and the second line ended with the same path again, which is left off.

That is the buffer header the vendor library ships without, carrying the binary image this part
uploads at initialisation. The operating system's rules do not admit a blob in its source, so it
is fetched into the workspace and is not in this repository either, which this volume's own rule
about vendoring would have required anyway. **West had to be found first**: it lives in the
workspace's virtual environment, and the earlier attempt failed with "command not found" in a
shell that had not activated it. Every Zephyr build so far had gone through plain `cmake`, so the
absence stayed invisible until something needed west itself.

**The cheap attempt links.** The part on this bench is described with the compatible string of
the generation before it, and the image builds:

```
-- Found devicetree overlay: overlays/existing_driver.overlay
[184/184] Linking C executable zephyr/zephyr.elf
Memory region         Used Size  Region Size  %age Used
           FLASH:      138964 B         2 MB      6.63%
             RAM:       13888 B       256 KB      5.30%
```

**The link succeeding is the proof that the in-tree driver was compiled in, and that is worth
stating rather than assuming.** The application takes its device from a devicetree alias through
`DEVICE_DT_GET`. If the driver had not been enabled, that macro would still have compiled and the
link would have failed on a device that no driver defines. So the chain holds end to end: the
overlay describes a part, the description enables the driver, the driver finds the vendor library
in the module, and the vendor library finds the image that was just fetched. None of that is a
statement about the hardware, which has not been powered yet.

**The image is 138964 bytes where P04's was 31412**, on the same board with a comparable
configuration. Most of the difference is this part's firmware image and the vendor library around
it, which is a product fact rather than a curiosity: a part whose driver is open and whose
firmware is not also costs flash for an image the host has to carry and upload. The exact split
is read off a size report rather than estimated here.

One warning is deliberate: `__ASSERT() statements are globally ENABLED`, from `CONFIG_ASSERT=y`.
P04 turned assertions off because they cost counts inside a measured interval. Nothing here is
measured.

### What the next run can return, written before it runs

The shield is not fitted yet. When it is, the identification run has four outcomes and they are
distinguishable, which is the reason for writing them down first:

| Outcome | What it means | What to change |
|---|---|---|
| READY | the existing driver binds and initialises this part, and the question becomes how far that goes | nothing; read the grid next |
| NOT READY, log names the image | the image did not reach the part | already fetched, so this would be a build that did not pick it up |
| NOT READY, no answer on the bus | the address is wrong, the interface jumper is on the other bus, or the part is held in its low-power state | 0x52 in the overlay, then the jumper, then the control line |
| build failure | the description is wrong | the overlay |

**The third row has three causes and they are ordered by cost rather than likelihood.** The
address is one digit in a file. The jumper is one look at the board. The control line is the
binding this project exists to write, and if that is the answer then the run has earned the
chapter.
